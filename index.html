				<h3> Assignment 1 </h3>
				hola
				First I tried to understand what a Git is, then that in specifically Gitlab, and in the middle of the way I found out that Github also exits. I found more information about Github, but this helped me clarify some things about Gitlab. In terms of concepts it is clear that the main use of the Git is its ability to control the versions of a main code so that it can be worked collaboratively, these systems also allow you to publish pages on the web and take advantage of the control system. Then I saw some tutorials from Gitkraken, this program was recommended to me by a classmate, he only mentioned it, but at that time I did not know what it was for. In the tutorials I understood that it serves to manage the files locally (make changes) and quickly update the files in the Git, and vice versa. Once I understood, in a general way, the use of Gitlab and Gitkraken, I started learning HTML, which is an exclusive language to give structure to a web page, it did not seem very difficult, however it has many commands and is somewhat tedious , then I understood that giving style to a web is very complicated with html, that's why a design language called css is used that simplifies this task a lot. My classmate also talked about the Bootstrap, so I decided to investigate what it was, then saw that it is incorporated into the workflow as a framework to make the layout of a page faster, using a grid system, and it is very simple to use, you just have to copy some links within the html code that you are putting together and then give the correct commands. Up here everything is fine, what I found very complicated, and it has taken me more time has been to upload the html I was creating to the Gitlab, in fact I have not managed to do it at all well. I managed to relatively easily upload my page to the Github, but as much as I tried I could not do it in the Gitlab. Finally I managed to clone a simple project that I found on the web, I passed those files to my folder of the Fabacademy, and modified the html by placing the code I was working on, and there if the Gitlab did not give me any errors, however, for some reason css style does not appear, although the Github page does.
